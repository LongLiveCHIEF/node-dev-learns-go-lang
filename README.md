# node-dev-learns-go-lang

I created this project to help myself learn go. I figure the best way to get
up to speed, is to take on some challenges that would be simple tasks for
me to complete in node.js.


## Challenge 1 - Create an HTTP Server 

- [ ] Static file server
- [ ] Returns a directory index on `host.com/path/` fragments
- [ ] Responds with 400 error code if directory and file path not found 

## Challenge 2 - Create a command line health check client

```
$ isgreen <ip_address> [--ports]

ip_address status:
port1: green
port2: green
port3: red
```
